    <h1>The Best Movie's According to Isaac</h1>
        <h2>My top 3 movies of all time:</h2>
        <hr />
            <h3>Coraline</h3>
                <p>
                    I love this movie because of the whimsical eerieness, animation style, and <br />
                    exploration of curiosity that it envokes.
                </p>
            <h3>The Joker</h3>
                <p>
                    I like this movie because of the alternative and open ended, imagination envoking <br />
                    story. This resenbles the same feeling as fight club where all scenes are open for <br />
                    Interpretation. I connected with this because the Joker is seen as an outcast and <br /> 
                    and avoided because of uncontrollable mental illness. This leads him to be shut off <br /> 
                    and abused by society until he reaches an intense boiling point. <br />
                </p>
            <h3>I am Legend</h3>
                <p>
                    I like this movie because it intesely pulls you into this post-apocalyptic <br />
                    world. You feel for the main character and see all he has lost and all he has. <br /> 
                    You watch as he try to cling on to any hope of connection and humanity. <br />
                </p>
